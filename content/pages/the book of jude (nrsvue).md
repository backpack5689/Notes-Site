## Salutation

  + Nothing of note here

## Occasion of the Letter

  + > ^{3}Beloved, while eagerly preparing to write to you about the salvation we share, I find it necessary to write and appeal to you to contend for the faith that was once and for all handed on to the saints. ^{4} For certain intruders have stolen in among you, people who long ago were {{< logseq/mark >}}designated for this condemnation as ungodly{{< / logseq/mark >}}, who {{< logseq/mark >}}pervert the grace of our God into debauchery{{< / logseq/mark >}} and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

  + Interesting that people were "designated for this condemnation as ungodly", does this mean that it was a part of God's plan?

  + What does an intruder today look like? I go to lukewarm Christians.

  + "pervert the grace of our God into debauchery" -- in the context of "Messy Grace", sounds like we are supposed to give that grace but people today use it to bludgeon people.

## Judgment on False Teachers

  + > ^{5} Now I desire to remind you, though you are fully informed, once and for all, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. ^{6} And the angels who did not keep their own position but deserted their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great day. ^{7} Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which, in the same manner as they, indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural lust, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
>
> ^{8} Yet in the same way these dreamers also defile the flesh, reject authority, and slander the glorious ones. ^{9} {{< logseq/mark >}}But when the archangel Michael disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, he did not dare to bring a condemnation of slander against him{{< / logseq/mark >}} but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” ^{10} But these people slander whatever they do not understand, and {{< logseq/mark >}}they are destroyed by those things that, like irrational animals, they know by instinct{{< / logseq/mark >}}. ^{11} Woe to them! For they go the way of Cain and abandon themselves to Balaam’s error for the sake of gain and perish in Korah’s rebellion. ^{12} These are blots on your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, feeding themselves. They are waterless clouds carried along by the winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted; ^{13} wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved forever.
> 
> ^{14} It was also about these that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, “See, the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones, ^{15} to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” ^{16} These are grumblers and malcontents; they indulge their lusts; their mouths utter bombastic nonsense, flattering people to their own advantage.

  + It's interesting that the archangel didn't bring condemnation of slander, or speak evil-ly against the devil -- lends itself to disagreeing gracefully.

    + Defining "slander" in this context:[^1]
> Usage of the word "slander" in the New Testament, which is akin to the Roman 1:30 usage, has a rather narrow range of application, emphasizing its meaning as "speaking evil against one's neighbor" (Kittel, 1967). This New Testament reference to "speaking evil" is not so much making a false report on another, as slander is typically used in the Old Testament, rather it appears to be an admonition to the early Church to refrain from hostile and malicious speech directly against a neighbor (Bromiley, 1988; Kittel, 1967).

  + So many things are known by instinct that are later referenced as a sin (ex. gluttony)
